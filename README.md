# GitHub Repo Search App

This project was created to allow users to search GitHub's Search API for a key phrase, sort by the repo with the most stars, and to filter the results by language. The user can also see more details for each result by selecting that repo from the table of results. 

This app is hosted on Heroku: https://wefso-github-search.herokuapp.com/
